      <p className='text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6'>
        Hi. I am an aspiring software engineer with a strong foundation in
        software development and sales. I am looking for a role that allows me
        to grow my skills as an engineer and provide me with mentorship. I
        believe I am a fast learner with a good work ethic and always focus on
        producing the best work I can. I am not afraid to ask questions and
        critique my own code.
      </p>
      <p className='text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6'>
        In my experience with software jobs, I mostly worked with JavaScript (my
        first internship I worked with Vue and in my second internship I worked
        with React and a little Python). Some personal hobbies I have are going
        to the gym, fishing, gaming, and driving motorcycles. Well, thatâ€™s me.
      </p>
